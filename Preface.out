Preface
The past few years document the following fact: The Web has irrevocably recastthe face of computing and programmers unwilling to master its environment willbe left behind.
The preceding is a strong statement. It is also true. More and more, applications
must interface to the Web. It no longer matters much what the application is, near
universal Web access is dragging, pushing, and coaxing programmers to program for
the online world, and Java is the language that many will use to do it. Frankly, fluency
in Java is no longer an option for the professional programmer, it is a requirement. This
book will help you acquire it.
Aside from being the preeminent language of the Internet, Java is important for
another reason: it has altered the course of computer language development. Many of
the features first mainstreamed by Java are now finding their way into other languages.
For example, the new C# language is strongly influenced by Java. Knowledge of Java
opens the door to the latest innovations in programming. Put directly, Java is one of the
world’s most important computer languages.

A Book for All Programmers
To use this book does not require any previous programming experience. However,
if you come from a C/C++ background, then you will be able to advance a bit more
rapidly. As most readers will know, Java is similar, in form and spirit, to C/C++. Thus,
knowledge of those langauges helps, but is not necessary. Even if you have never
programmed before, you can learn to program in Java using this book.
What’s Inside
This book covers all aspects of the Java programming language. Part 1 presents an
in-depth tutorial of the Java language. It begins with the basics, including such things
as data types, control statements, and classes. Part 1 also discusses Java’s
exception-handling mechanism, multithreading subsystem, packages, and interfaces.
Part 2 examines the standard Java library. As you will learn, much of Java’s power
is found in its library. Topics include strings, I/O, networking, the standard utilities,
the Collections Framework, applets, GUI-based controls, and imaging.
Part 3 looks at some issues relating to the Java development environment, including
an overview of Java Beans, Servlets, and Swing.
Part 4 presents a number of high-powered Java applets that serve as extended
examples of the way Java can be applied. The final applet, called Scrabblet, is a complete,
multiuser networked game. It shows how to handle some of the toughest issues involved
in Web-based programming.
What’s New in the Fifth Edition
The differences between this and the previous editions of this book mostly involve those
features added by Java 2, version 1.4. Of the many new features found in version 1.4,
perhaps the most important are the assert keyword, the channel-based I/O subsystem,
chained exceptions, and networking enhancements. This fifth edition has been fully
updated to reflect those and other additions. New features are clearly noted in the text,
as are features added by previous releases.
This fifth edition also updates and restores the Sevlets chapter. Previously
this chapter relied upon the now out-dated JSDK (Java Servlets Developers Kit)
to develop and test servlets. It now uses Apache Tomcat, which is the currently
recommended tool.
Don’t Forget: Code on the Web
Remember, the source code for all of the examples and projects in this book is available
free-of-charge on the Web at www.osborne.com.

Special Thanks
Special thanks to Patrick Naughton. Patrick was one of the creators of the Java
language. He also helped write the first edition of this book. For example, much of
the material in chapters 17, 18, 23, 29, 30, 31, and 32 was initially provided by Patrick.
His insights, expertise, and energy contributed greatly to the success of this book.
Thanks also go to Joe O'Neil for providing the initial drafts for chapters 24, 25, 26,
and 27. Joe has helped on several of my books and, as always, his efforts are appreciated.
