*NOTE* This repo's code has been merged into and improved upon in the repository textrank, under this same organization. Those interested are advised to look at the AccessBookmarks.java class in textrank repository rather than here for pdf to text conversion java code.

Java code using Apache PDFBox API. 
Converts pdf with bookmarks to chapterwise text files.

AccessBookmarks.java main2 method does the following:
1) Prints the entire index of any pdf file. Path of input file is actually taken as user input but is currently hardcoded for faster testing. 
2) Extracts text between 2 particular bookmarks and writes it to a textfile.

main method :
1) recursively accesses bookmarks till it reaches leaf
2)prints contents between 2 leaves to file of same name as leaf[BUG IN LEAF WITH NO NEXT SIBLING]

todo:
1)fix bug for leaf with no sibling
2) output should be directory structure similar to bookmarks tree structure
