Java code using Apache PDFBox API. 
Converts pdf with bookmarks to chapterwise text files.

AccessBookmarks.java code does the following:
1) Prints the entire index of any pdf file. Path of input file is actually taken as user input but is currently hardcoded for faster testing. 
2) Extracts text between 2 particular bookmarks and writes it to a textfile.


Todo:
1) make the function recursive instead of iterative to handle any number or levels of bookmarks. 
2) write each leaf bookmarks contents to textfile. All output textfiles should be in a directory structure same as bookmarks tree structure.
